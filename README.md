# libeasykey [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arraystock/libeasykey.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arraystock/libeasykey) [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/arraystock/libeasykey/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/arraystock/libeasykey)
A simplistic library for reading and writing data.

## About
`libeasykey` is designed to be a simple yet fully-featured library for reading and writing data to and from `ini` files.

It should also work great in systems with very little memory due to how it does not read the entire file to RAM. Instead, it reads the file line-by-line to find what it needs and uses minimal memory.

## Documentation
All official documentation is in the [wiki](https://github.com/arraystock/libeasykey/wiki).

## License
`libeasykey` is released under the MIT License. See the file [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for more information.
